# Sudoku Solver (Brute Force Algorithm)

<p>
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids 
that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

A brute force algorithm in C++ is implemented.
It visits the empty cells in order, filling in a valid number sequentially
and backtracking if necessary when the number is found to be no longer valid.
